## Election-Audit Summary: 

In a summary statement, provide a business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used—with some modifications—for any election. Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections.

The script that is created is to run an analysis on the election commision for 3 counties with 3 candidates.  The script will help in identifying which candidate won, with their winning percentages along with winning county.  All the numbers and details are stored a file which can be shared and distributed.

You can use this script for any number of candidates and counties by:

    1.  Making changes to the elections_results.csv file.  
            (I) In this file you can add as many candidates as you can and the script will help you in idetifying the winner.
            (II) You can also add more details to the candidates - like age, sex, etc.

    2.  This script can be used on a larger scale like state elections again, by adding the information required to the elections_results.csv file.
